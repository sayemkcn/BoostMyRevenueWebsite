Cookies: A “cookie” is a small file stored by your browser when told to do so by a website. Typically websites place a number of different cookies on an end-user’s machine. Some of the cookies are “1st Party,” from the website itself, and others are “3rd party,” belonging to advertising and analytics entities or social networks.  ShareMyRevenue’s cookies do not include personal data and are typically used to quickly identify your device and to “remember” your browser during subsequent visits for purposes of functionality, preferences, and website performance.

If ShareMyRevenue learns that ShareMyRevenue has inadvertently gathered personal data from children under 13 years of age, ShareMyRevenue will take reasonable measures to promptly delete such personal data from ShareMyRevenue’s records.

ShareMyRevenue understands the need to provide extra privacy protections to users who are children. To that end, features and services such as social networking plug-ins, behaviorally targeted advertising, and collection of data for the purpose of building user profiles are not available to users under 13. ShareMyRevenue also does not allow our third party partners who engage in such practices to access personally identifiable data from users under 13.

ShareMyRevenue and its partners do collect non-personally identifiable data from children. This includes, for example, collection of IP-based geolocation data to ensure that the product, service or features served comply with applicable laws of that nation.

ShareMyRevenue and its partners also collect data to assess general information about the use of products, such as the number of visitors to our sites and services and which sections of a site or service are popular. ShareMyRevenue also uses this data to provide contextually-relevant advertising to users, to prevent users from seeing the same ad repeatedly, and to allow users to personalize their experience on the site or service (for example, to save a high score in a game). ShareMyRevenue and its partners may also use cookies, pixels, hardware-based identifiers, Operating System-based identifiers, and software-set identifiers, to manage and measure the performance of advertising.

Please note that ShareMyRevenue’s partners may have their own policies related to tracking technologies for analytics and ad-serving purposes.  While
ShareMyRevenue requires that companies comply with ShareMyRevenue’s privacy policy before ShareMyRevenue allows those companies to access our sites and services, ShareMyRevenue does not actually control third-party data collection and use. ShareMyRevenue encourages parents to review the list of operators below and to become familiar with those parties policies and practices.

If you have additional questions about ShareMyRevenue’s Privacy Practices related to children under the age of 13, please contact us at info@ShareMyRevenue.net.
